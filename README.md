## 📈 Insights & Data Story
Some of the key insights discovered:
- 🚀 **Top-performing brands/models** generate a major share of sales revenue.  
- 📅 **Seasonality in sales** shows peak months and periods of decline.
- **🚗 Body Type based sales** shows sales or revenue based on cars body type.

  
**Data Story:**  
The analysis shows that while overall sales are strong, growth is uneven across brands and regions. By focusing on high-performing markets and optimizing underperforming ones, companies can capture untapped revenue opportunities. The data-driven story highlights who is buying, where sales are thriving, and how performance changes over time, giving decision-makers a clear roadmap for strategic action.
